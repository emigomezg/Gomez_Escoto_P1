 \brief
 This is the source file for the DAC device driver for Kinetis K64.
 It contains all the implementation for configuration functions and runtime functions.
 i.e., this is the application programming interface (API) for the DAC peripheral.

 \todo
 Interrupts are not implemented in this API implementation.
